    dis: 'YAMAHA XSR 155 was first launched in Thailand in 2019 with the same engine as the YAMAHA YZF R15 Version 3.0 and MT-15. Hence, it is the Neo-retro standard version of the “R” & “MT”-series DNA and so, the XSR name is justified following the trends of its big-engine cousins. This bike is slotted under the R & MT series for extreme city service in sheer style.'
